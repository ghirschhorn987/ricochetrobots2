Solving in reverse:

class RestrictionSet {
  Set<Restrictions> restriction;
}
  
class Restriction {
  Robot robot;
  Set<Position> positionsToAvoid;
}

MoveList getMovesNeeded(Robot robot, Position target, int maxMoves, RestrictionSet restrictions, BoardState boardState) {
  Position robotPosition = getRobotPosition(boardState, robot);
  if (robotPosition.equals(target)) {
    return new MoveList();
  }
  // Find reverse positions from target with
  for (Direction direction : getPossibleDirections(target, boardState)){
    for (Position possiblePosition : getPossiblePositionsToMoveTo(target, direction, boardState)) {
      Direction leftDirection = getDirectionToLeft(direction);
      Direction rightDirection = getDirectionToRight(direction);
      if (hasWall(possiblePosition, leftDirection)) {
        
      
      
      
        Restriction restriction = buildRestriction(robot, getPositionsBetween(robotPosition, possiblePosition, direction, boardState)
        
      }
    
}
